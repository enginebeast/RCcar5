While working on my project, I realized that IR remote control wasn't suitable my project. The IR sensor doesn't work properly when obstacles block the signal. So, I decided to find another way to control my RC car.

First, I considered modifying the prototype RC car remote control. But, I canceled this decision, because I wasn't convinced that I was able to make arduino to receive radio waves of prototype remote control. 

Second, I considered using a smartphone remote control app with a Bluetooth module to control the RC car. Although the app maker’s UI for Arduino is limited, this isn’t a big problem. Initially, my goal in creating a remote control system was simply to check whether the RC car was working correctly, so I didn’t need detailed control. If I want more advanced control in the future, I can solve it at the Raspberry Pi level.
